For this project is about pancake stake sorting of different sizes that can flip from the top ’n’ pancake. 

For the A*search that count the forward and backward functions, in this function I have designed to use r as randomize pancake for test, or I can write the pancake number by myself to test for 10-pancake stack.
A * search algorithm assume the state space of all possible pancake can flip and calculate the total cost, the priority queue is design to the lowest cost. In this function, gap heuristic is provided, it designed by pancake at that position is not of adjacent size to the pancake below. Backward is total number of pancake flipped to get the current position.
